# moveit_with_GPD
One stop repo to install what will be required to run moveit and its dependencies for grasp pose detection on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic using UR5 and Robotiq Gripper 85. 
Lots of efforts, links, git issues, errors, forum searches and debugs later. 
A repo that moveit tutorials wanted us to use but on UR. 
sudo apt install required dependencies using the instructions of the readme-s of these repos (except gpd pcl and opencv dependencies), 
extract all the folders into your src folder, catkin build it and do what ever you wanna pursue :)
